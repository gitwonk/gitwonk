Technical documentations are the fundamental building blocks of any product yet â€”_they still remain a pain point for many teams and enterprises_.

- Why they don't have good integration with other third-party services? with GitLab or Bit Bucket?
- Why there is no open source _SaaS provider_ with good data protection policy and self-hosting as a feature?
- Aren't you tired of same old documentation tools with not great UX and a lot of frills? We are. That's why we built something epic.

Introducing **GitWonk**, an open source alternative to GitBook, designed and built focusing on the _developer experience_.
